# DesignPatterns
Presentation of design patterns.

Factory - A factory returns an instance of any one of several possible classes that have a common parent class. The common parent class can be an abstract class, or an interface. The calling program typically has a way of telling the factory what it wants, and the factory makes the decision which subclass should be returned to the calling program. It then creates an instance of that subclass, and then returns it to the calling program.

Abstract Factory - Provides a contract for creating families of related or dependent objects without having to specify their concrete classes.
